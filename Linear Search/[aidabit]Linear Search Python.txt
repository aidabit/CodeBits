In Python it is not necessary to have a main function
however to assimilate the code you can have it like this
'''

#In python you have to make sure to create the functions first before calling them.
def main():
    
    array = [1,7,2,4,3,6,9,0,5];
    valueSearching = 7;
    print("Searching for {0} in array...".format(valueSearching));
    print("{0} was found in place number {1}.".format(valueSearching, searchArray(valueSearching, array)));
    
    
def searchArray(valueSearching, array):
    for i in range(0, len(array)):
        if array[i] == valueSearching:
            return i;
    
    
    return -1;

#This is the only line that will be read because all the other ones are function creations.
main();
